## Description

Bot Army Management App is a web application that allows users to manage their collection of bots. Users can view the profiles of all available bots, add individual bots to their army, release bots from the army, and discharge bots permanently from service.

## Features

- View profiles of all available bots in a clean and organized manner.
- Add individual bots to your bot army by clicking on them. A bot can be enlisted only once.
- Release bots from your bot army by clicking on them. The bot will be removed from the army but remains in the available bots collection.
- Discharge bots permanently from service by clicking the red "x" button. The bot will be deleted from both the backend and the bot army.

## Technologies Used

- React: Frontend JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for styling the app.
- JSON Server: Simulated backend API to store bot data.
- JavaScript ES6: Modern JavaScript syntax for writing clean and efficient code.
